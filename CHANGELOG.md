## UUID handling
This was the first bump in the road that was annoying as hell. The problem was to manage UUID ownership for `Order` and `Trade` structs while trying to optimize memory (and time) as much as possible.

### v1
At the start, I had the `Order` object initialize its `id` upon creation using the `uuid_generator` and then converting this to string using the `uuids::to_string` method. Then when an order is matched, it would generate a `Trade` object that holds a `string_view` to the buyer and seller `Order`'s `id` fields while also storing its own trade `id` which is a string again generated by the `uuid_generator`.

Clearly, this comes with some problems:
1. `std::string` itself is large and the UUID string is a 36-character array which totals up to ~60 bytes (24 + 36)
2. When an `Order` is matched, it gets removed from from the `OrderBook` since there's no use for it anymore. If the user doesn't store a reference to the `Order` object, it gets deallocated along with its UUID string hence leaving the `string_view`s in `Trade` and `OrderResult` dangling. The latter is not that big of a problem but `Trade`s are stored in the `OrderBook`'s `tradeList` so that's definitely a problem.

### v2
Clearly something had to be done regarding the UUID persistence and its size overhead. The easiest solution was to just have `Trade` and `OrderResult` store copies of the UUID's they are referencing but that would mean a `Trade` would be at least 180 bytes and that is unacceptable since this is not Python.

Looking back, in a day, a blue-chip stock would have around 150K trades a day and that would only total up to 30MB worth of trades for an orderbook per day which is acceptable. But then again, why code in C++ if I'm not gonna fuss over memory optimization. Also, less copying -> faster execution and that's definitely important for HFT.

The first solution was to use an `uint64_t` based internal mapping (I'll just say int from now) for the objects and then store the UUID strings in an `idPool` map in the `OrderBook` itself. So now, instead of an `Order` and a `Trade` having a UUID string, it just holds an int that maps to a UUID string. Also, any references to a UUID can be represented by an 8 byte int instead of a 16 byte `string_view`. This way, we solve both problems from before:
1. An int is only 8 bytes which is much smaller compared to a `std::string`
2. Even if an `Order` gets deallocated, its UUID string would still be stored in the `OrderBook` so there's no risk of dangling references in `Trade` and `OrderResult` objects

In essence, `Order`s and `Trade`s would be managed internally using an int but an API would still return a UUID string when these objects are returned. Also, this means that `Order` cannot initialize a UUID in its constructor anymore. Instead, when it is placed, the `OrderBook` assigns an int internal id, generate a UUID string and store this mapping in `idPool`.

### v3
Could have called it a day there but we can do better. One thing I realized after skimming through the [uuid library](include/libraries/uuid.h) is that the `uuids::uuid` objects themselves are actually just 16-byte int arrays which is half as small as their string representations! Why bother storing UUID string when I can store the `uuids::uuid` arrays directly and that's what I did. So I swapped all UUID strings to `uuids::uuid` and we all lived happily ever after.

### v4
I soon came to realize there was an unnecessary level of indirection and internal mapping here. Why should I use an internal int mapping when I can just store pointers to the `uuids::uuid` objects instead? So instead of going to `idPool` and finding the UUID that corresponds to the int id, just dereference the pointer. Eureka!

So I removed all internal int id implementation, and make everyone just store pointers to their `uuids::uuid` in `idPool` which is now an `unordered_set` instead of an `unordered_map` since we don't need the int keys anymore and we all lived happily ever after (hopefully)

### v5
Oh how I thought I wouldn't have to update this section anymore. Something I just realized is that order books should store a list of their orders somewhere for bookkeeping. Then, somehow along the train of thought I clocked that the returned `OrderResult` after placing an order should probably be self-containing instead of holding references to the `OrderBook`'s copies of stuff.

The reason is because `OrderResult`s are not managed by the `OrderBook` and exists solely to report the result of the order (aha!). Hence, if it contains references to stuff inside the `OrderBook` like `Trade`s in `tradeList` and UUID in `idPool`, the pointers would be invalid if the `OrderBook` were to, say, flush the storage into a database. The only thing it should point to is the `remainingOrder` which is actually still in the `OrderBook` and managed by it.

Also, it is up to the user to store the `OrderResult` and they could very much not store them if they don't want to. So, they can fuss over the memory management of those copies. Hence, a large scale change to change `OrderResult` to store copies instead of pointers are done and an `orderList` is maintained in the `OrderBook`

P.S. Now I realize this isn't really related to UUID handling but whatever

## Thoughts

### Cache alignment
Started fussing over cache alignment here. `Order` objects are already 64 bytes (perfect!) but `Trade`s are 48 bytes but their corresponding id's are 16 bytes. Thing is, there's no reason to store the trade id's in `idPool` since no other objects point to them except the `Trade`s themselves which persists in the `tradeList`. There are two approaches I considered here
- Store `uuid` directly in `Trade` instead of a pointer. Pros: Pads up to 56 bytes, doesn't require dereferencing to get `id`. Cons: Have to change current implementation and tests
- When I get to the memory allocator part, make sure each `Trade` objects are stored next to their id in memory. Pros: Pads up exactly to 64 bytes, no need to change implementation except maybe change tests that check trade id is stored in `idPool`. Cons: Way more complicated and probably wouldn't be worth it

As I thought about the second approach more, I started to think would optimizing the `Trade` placement in memory for cache alignment be worth it? After all, `Trade`s aren't a big part of the `OrderBook` operations anyways. They are created once when `Order`s match, stored in `tradeList` for bookkeeping and sent as copies to users. After that, no further references to them are made except probably when they are flushed into a database. I'll take a look again once I've got the basic implementation done and get some benchmarks setup but this thought process is good to document so I don't have to think about it all over again in case `Trade` memory alignment do become a bottleneck for some reason.
